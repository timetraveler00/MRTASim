# MRTASim
MRTASim is a simulation software developed for executing multi-robot coordination coordination scenarios. 
MRTASim uses JADE (Java Agent-Based Development Environment) and allows comparing variations of functions such as path planning, bid valuation, and task scheduling. It displays the results on maps prepared in the environment editor, and automated experiments ensure the accuracy of the results. Academic studies produced with the software, which is constantly updated with new methods and parameters, have been presented at conferences and published in journals.
